# Solidity Setup

Setting up this repo to practice solidity programming. The goal for this repo is to look at developing a variety of smart contracts in solidity across different use cases and verticals.

The first goal is setting up an online bank, which will have verifications handled on the ethreum platform. All necessary functions of a bank will be explored under this smart contract, with the goal for it to emulate a fully capable and functional bank, resting on blockchain.

We will look to define the following items:
Setting up a user
Requesting account balance
Withdrawing funds 
Transferring funds between banks
Displaying error messages when insufficient funds are available
